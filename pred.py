This program simulates realizations of a stochastic predator-prey model. The
model is described by Linda Allen in "An Introduction to Stochastic Processes
with Applications to Biology."

The stochastic work is done in the function stochastic_pred_prey(). The
deterministic version is included for comparison in deterministic_pred_prey().
