    will become extinct at exactly the same time? Should be answerable by
    finding the p.d.f. p_0(t) for the processes, then multiplying them together
    for some t_0. That won't answer the probability of _any_ t_0, though, just
    a particular one. The function p_0(t) can be obtained through the matrix
    exponential, since the state space is finite for the death process.)
