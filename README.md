# cmc (Continuous-time Markov Chains)

This repository contains the work of a semester studying continuous time Markov
chains. It holds the LaTeX source for the paper product, and also the python
code for generating the images in the paper.

To provide a "snippet" for anyone interested in browsing this repository,
consider the following scenario:

Suppose that, to demonstrate of some fact from probability, we stand in the
middle of a room holding an open bag of marbles. While puzzling over the
differences between combinations, permutations, and whether or not we _really_
care, we are struck with a fit a mathematical rage. We violently shake our bag,
and marbles fly out of the opening one by one. The marbles first fly from the
bag quickly, but soon fall slower and slower. After some time, the marbles are
all gone from the bag. With our fit over and our sanity restored, we become
curious about our experiment gone wrong. How long were we standing there
shaking our bag of marbles? If we were to repeat this marble-shaking process,
how long might we _expect_ to stand there? To answer these questions, we can
use a continuous time Markov chain.
